🚀 Canva to Flutter UI Challenge - 1 🎨➡️📱

As a Flutter learner, I picked a random UI design from Canva and challenged myself to recreate it in Flutter! 🛠️ This was a great way to practice UI development and improve my Flutter skills.

🔹 Canva Design: [Canva UI](https://marketplace.canva.com/EAGYaHWP8ik/1/0/739w/canva-xX5j3iHJ2NQ.jpg)</br>
